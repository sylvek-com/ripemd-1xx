This directory contains a description and software for the RIPEMD-160 and 
RIPEMD-128 hash functions, as well as software for the MDx-MACs based on
RIPEMD-160 and RIPEMD-128. The implementations are written for the sole
purpose of documentation. No optimization whatsoever is performed: only
readability and portability were kept in mind.  


ripemd160.ps.gz: description of RIPEMD-160 and RIPEMD-128. This has also
been published in Fast Software Encryption, LNCS 1039, D. Gollmann (Ed.),
pp. 71-82. This version differs from the published version in that a figure
has been added, four small mistakes in the pseudo-code of Appendix A
have been corrected, and the order in which the permutations pi and rho^i
are applied in Section 3 have been exchanged. In addition, the hash value
of the message consisting of 1 million 'a' characters has been added to
Appendix B for both RIPEMD-160 and RIPEMD-128.

rmd160.c: source code for RIPEMD-160

rmd160.h: include file for RIPEMD-160. Make sure that the types byte
and dword are respectively 8 and 32-bit unsigned quantities.

rmd128.c: source code for RIPEMD-128

rmd128.h: include file for RIPEMD-128. Make sure that the types byte
and dword are respectively 8 and 32-bit unsigned quantities.

hashtest.c: driver for both RIPEMD-160 and RIPEMD-128. Default is
RIPEMD-160. For compilation with rmd128.c define RMDsize=128.
Command line arguments of hashtest: any combination of 
   filename  -- compute hash code of file read binary
   -sstring  -- print string & hashcode
   -t        -- perform time trial
   -x        -- execute standard test suite, ASCII input
A bug in the RMDonemillion() function of this driver has been corrected. 
 

rmd160mc.c: source code for RIPEMD160-MAC

rmd160mc.h: include file for RIPEMD160-MAC. Make sure that the types byte
and dword are respectively 8 and 32-bit unsigned quantities.

rmd128mc.c: source code for RIPEMD128-MAC

rmd128mc.h: include file for RIPEMD128-MAC. Make sure that the types byte
and dword are respectively 8 and 32-bit unsigned quantities.

mactest.c: driver for both RIPEMD160-MAC and RIPEMD128-MAC. Default is
RIPEMD160-MAC. For compilation with rmd128mc.c define RMDsize=128.
Command line arguments of mactest: any combination of 
   filename keyfilename -- compute MAC of file binary read using 
                           key in keyfilename (hexadecimal format)
   -sstring  -- print string & MAC for default key
   -t        -- perform time trial                        
   -x        -- execute standard test suite, ASCII input
